# Transfermarket Analysis ðŸ“Š  
ðŸš€ *Analysis of the best league to league transfers*

## Project

The primary goal of this project was to analyze league to league transfers. What is league to league transfer? For example you are a player who goes from Ajax to Barselona. It means that you goes from first devision of Netherlands domestic chempionship to first division of Spanish domestic chempionship. In our final table we will see it like `from_NL1_to_ES1` in `from_league_to_league` column or like `from_Netherlands_to_Spain` in `from_country_to_country` column. The purpose is to find best of from league to league transfers based on our metrics. The metric we will use in that project is how in average market value of player changes after 1 year of transfer. The logic is simple: if you are young player and the change of league suits you the most you will play good and that will increase your market value.

This analysis can be usefull like for manegers of clubs who are looking for new signing to point the league in wicth potential new player now playes. Or for players who want to play in big leagues like England or Spain and they look for the best tramplin 'springboard' league fir that.
